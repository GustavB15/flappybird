# flappybird
Project made in the course IS1200 at KTH. It is a remake of the classic flappy bird game. The game is made mostly in C and compiled to MIPS code which runs on the chipKIT 32-bit uno board. Uses I/O on the board for controlling and displaying the game. As well as timer interrupts to ensure consistent updates.
